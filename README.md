# TerraProbe - Code Repository
This project's goal is to create an autonomous robot that collects a intact soil core of 12 inches. Primary goal is to be used in agriculture. This repository contains the modeling, motor control, data acquistion, and dashboard code for the same.

The full design was done in 3 Stages 

[PDR](#Preliminary-Design-Review)

[CDR](#Critical-Design-Review)

[FDR](#Final-Design-Review)


## Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
This phase involved the concept generation, market analysis, intitial technical analysis, and economic consideration

The documentation for the same can be found [here](Documentation/PDR)


## Critical Design Review 
This phase involved refining preliminary ideas agreed upon by the team in PDR and creating CAD models with design for manufacture (DFM) and assembly (DFA) being held central. First iterations of mechanisms ,electronics, and software were created. 

The documentation for the same can be found [here](Documentation/CDR)

## Final Design Review
This phase revolved around realizing our final prototype - the soil sampler (TerraProbe), the data acquisition system (TerraPal), and the Dashboard (TerraSoilIQ).
