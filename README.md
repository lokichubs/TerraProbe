# TerraProbe - Code Repository
This project's goal is to create an autonomous robot that collects a intact soil core of 12 inches. Primary goal is to be used in agriculture. This repository contains the modeling, motor control, and data acquistion code for the same.

The full design was done in 3 Stages 

[PDR](#Preliminary-Design-Review)

[CDR](#Critical-Design-Review)

[FDR](#Final-Design-Review)



## Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
This phase involved the concept generation, market analysis, intitial technical analysis, and economic consideration

The documentation for the same can be found [here](Documentation/PDR)


## Critical Design Review 
This phase is ongoing

## Final Design Review
